[Multi-VM Sandbox Installer](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra/tree/master/deployment/sandbox-v2) is a completely automated deployer that packs all MOSIP modules in a Kubernetes cluster of virtual machines that may be either on cloud or on-premise.  The automation is written in Ansible and Helm.
