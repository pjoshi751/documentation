# MOSIP Configurability for Biometrics
MOSIP can be configured to work with proxy implementation and multiple biometric modalities(Fingerprint, Iris and Face). Below are configurations to enable biometrics in MOSIP.

## Registration Client   

### Adding SDK in classpath
Biometric Windows SDK (jar file) should be placed in `lib` folder after extracting Registration-Client zip file, and then execute `run.bat` file.     

### Enabling MDS integration
The below property should updated to enable MDS integration. This property is present in [registration-env.properties](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-config/tree/master/config-templates/registration-env.properties) file. 

```
mosip.mdm.enabled=Y
```
 
### Registering biometric devices for registration
* `Register Device Provider` - Device Provider can be registered with MOSIP using [Register Device Provider API](Device-Management-APIs.md#post-deviceprovider)    
* `Register MDS` - MDS can be registered with MOSIP using [Register MDS API](Device-Management-APIs.md#post-mosipdeviceservice)     
* `Whitelist Device` - Biometric Devices can be white-listed using below steps:      
	* Add Device Specification (like model, make, etc.) using [Device Specification API](Device-APIs.md#post-devicespecifications)
	* Map Biometric Devices to Device Specifications using [Device API](Device-APIs.md#post-devices)
	* Map White-listed Device to a Center ID to which Registration Client is tagged using [Registration Centre Device API](Registration-Center-APIs.md#post-registrationcenterdevice)   
* `Register Device` - Biometric device can be registered using MOSIP using [Register Device API](Device-Management-APIs.md#post-registereddevices)   

### Enabling biometric for officer and supervisor
Biometric authentication for officer and supervisor can be enabled by updating the `is_active` column to `true` in `mosip_master.app_authentication_method` table. List of processes for which biometric authentication can be enabled in registration client      
* packet_auth (Authentication when packet is created)
* login_auth (Login to registration client)
* exception_auth (Authentication when an exception packet is created)
* eod_auth (Authentication for apporoving EOD packets) 

By default, username password based authentication is enabled for all the above processes.

### Enabling local de-duplication
Below properties should be enabled for performing local de-duplication. These properties are present in config file [registration-env.properties](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-config/tree/master/config-templates/registration-env.properties)     

```
mosip.registration.mds.fingerprint.dedup.enable.flag=Y    
mosip.registration.mds.iris.dedup.enable.flag=Y    
mosip.registration.mds.face.dedup.enable.flag=Y    
```

## Registration Processor    

### Configuring ABIS queue
ABIS queue can be configured in [RegistrationProcessorAbis-env.json](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-config/blob/master/config-templates/RegistrationProcessorAbis-env.json) file. registration-processor-abis-middleware-stage communicates to ABIS through queue configured. It sends request to inbound queue address and receives response from outbound queue address. If there are multiple ABIS, then it can be added in same file.

## ID Authentication

### Adding SDK in classpath
Below properties should be set in id-authentication-{env}.properties. The classes configured below will be loaded in classpath during application initialization.

````
ida.fingerprint.provider=<fully qualified classname of Biometric SDK>
ida.face.provider=<fully qualified classname of Biometric SDK>  
ida.iris.provider=<fully qualified classname of Biometric SDK>
ida.composite.biometric.provider=<fully qualified classname of Biometric SDK>
````   

### Registering biometric devices for authentication   
* `Register Device Provider` - Device Provider can be registered with MOSIP using [Register Device Provider API](Device-Management-APIs.md#post-deviceprovider)    
* `Register MDS` - MDS can be registered with MOSIP using [Register MDS API](Device-Management-APIs.md#post-mds)   
* `Register Device` - Biometric device can be registered using MOSIP using [Register Device API](Device-Management-APIs.md#post-registereddevices)     
* Update the code of the registered device to the serial number of the device in `register_device_master` and `register_device_master_h` table.

### Encrypting biometric data from MDS
In order to capture encrypted biometrics from MDS, MDS should use Mosip Public Key. This key should be generated in MOSIP with `IDA-FIR` as reference-ID for Parter-based Individual Authentication and 'INTERNAL' as reference-ID for Internal Authentication.
