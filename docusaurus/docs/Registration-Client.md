# Overview
The registration client is a thick Java-based client where the resident's demographic and biometric details are captured along with the supporting documents in online or offline mode.   The captured information is packaged in a secure tamper-proof way and send to the server for processing.

Registration client must provide the following :
* **Secure** way of capturing an individual's demographic and biometric data. The captured data must be cryptographically secure such that the data cannot be tampered with.   This is called a registration packet.
* **Interfaces to biometric devices** that comply to industry standards. This ensure that any device manufactured as per standards will work with MOSIP.
* Works in **online and offline** mode. In remote areas where internet connectivity is a challenge, the registration client must work in offline mode.
* **Remote software update** capability.  There must be a way to self-update to latest patches/upgrades (bug fixes/enhancements) in a remote way. There could be hundreds of client instances running on laptops/desktops. Updates on all of them must be controlled a central server.
* **Tamper-proof client software**.  The registration client must have an ability to validate the structure of the information captured so that it could detect any anomoly due to a possible manual tampering and reject the captured packet.

# Registration packet structure
All the registration information is zipped and encrypted in a packet and sent to the server. The structure of the packet is given [here](Registration-Packet.md).

# Registration client reference application
MOSIP provides an Windows-based reference implementation of the client that has a UI and the business logic to perform the above process flows.  The code, design, App setup, build documentation is available in [registration client repo](https://github.com/mosip/registration/tree/master/registration).  The App may be modified according to a country's need.
