Providing unique identity for a resident is one of key features of any identity platform. Hence, in MOSIP, we provide features like demographic and biometric de-duplication followed by manual adjudication to identify the uniqueness of a resident's demographic and biometric details.

# De-Duplication
De-duplication is the process to find a duplicate by comparing the individualâ€™s details (biometric and demographic data) with the data stored in the system. 

## Demographic De-Duplication
In demographic de-duplication the MOSIP system compares some of the demographic data (i.e. Name, Date of Birth and Gender) of the resident against the data present in MOSIP System (the resident's those who have already registered in MOSIP). If any potential match is found, the MOSIP system sends the resident's biometrics to the ABIS system to confirm if the biometrics are also matching.

### Process Flow
1. MOSIP System receives a request to perform demographic de-duplication for Person A.
2. MOSIP System performs demographic de-duplication for Person A by,
	i. Adding Person A's details (i.e. name, date of birth and gender) in the database.
	ii. Comparing Person's details against all the records in the database.
3. Let's say the MOSIP System find duplicates against two records - Person B and Person C.
	i. If Person B's registration has failed we consider Person B not to be a potential match for Person A.
	ii. If Person C's registration is completed and a UIN is associated then we consider Person C to be a potential match for Person A.
4. Now the list of Potential Matches for Person A (here, we only have Person C as the only potential match, there can be a scenario where there are multiple potential matches for Person A) are sent to ABIS to perform de-duplication against the potential matches.
5. As here, we ask ABIS to just perform match of Person A's biometrics with Person C's biometrics, we call this process a Gallery Match in ABIS. As we are asking ABIS to perform biometric de-duplication of Person A against the gallery that we have sent.

## Biometric De-Duplication
In biometric de-duplication the MOSIP system sends the biometrics of the resident to an ABIS System (Automated Biometrics Identification System). Here, the expectation from the ABIS system is to perform biometric de-duplication (1:N match) against all the records that it has stored earlier. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Any Packet irrespective of it has gone through demographic de-duplication or ABIS gallery match, will go through the biometric de-duplication stage.
{% endhint %}

### Process Flow
1. MOSIP system receives a request to perform biometric de-duplication for Person A.
2. MOSIP system sends an insert request to the ABIS system to insert Person A's biometrics in ABIS via. a queue.
3. ABIS system processes the request sent by MOSIP and sends a response back to MOSIP via. a queue.
4. MOSIP system now sends a identify request to the ABIS system to perform de-duplication for Person A in ABIS via. a queue.
5. ABIS System processes the request and sends the list of potential matches back to MOSIP via. a queue.
6. Let's say the ABIS system has found duplicates against two records - Person B and Person C.
	i. If Person B's registration has failed we consider Person B not to be a potential match for Person A.
	ii. If Person C's registration is completed and a UIN is associated then we consider Person C to be a potential match for Person A.
7. Not the list of Potential Matches for Person A (here, we only have Person C as the only potential match, there can be a scenario where there are multiple potential matches for Person A) are sent to Manual Adjudicator to take the final decision.

# Manual Adjudication
When biometric duplicates are found in ABIS, the system integrator can plug-in the Manual Adjudication Stage, which would send the biometric and demographic data of the duplicates to a Manual Adjudicator. The Manual Adjudicator now can perform various validations on the duplicate data and inform the MOSIP system if the two records are duplicates or not.

In our current implementation we have kept Manual Adjudication only after biometric de-duplication in-order to confirm if the duplicates marked by the ABIS will be not issued a UIN. 

The Manual Adjudication stage can be plugged-in after demographic de-duplication also but we have done so for our current implementation because, we already do a two step verification i.e. demo match and then ABIS gallery match to confirm a duplicate.

## Manual Adjudication APIs
* **Assignment API** - This API is used to assign one single unassigned applicant record to the manual adjudicator. The Assignement logic is based on First come First server based on the logged in Manual Adjudicator.
* **Fetch Demographic** - The manual adjudicator has to verify the applicant demographic information. This API is used to get the applicant demographic information from packet.
* **Fetch Biometrics** - The manual adjudicator would need to verify the applicant biometric and demographic records. This API is used to get the applicant biometric file from packet.
* **Fetch Packet Meta Information** - The manual adjudicator has to verify the operator/supervisor/introducer etc.; information. This API fetches the additional information from packet.
* **Desion API** - This API is used to get the decision from manual adjudicator for an applicant and update the decision in table. The packet is sent for further processing based on decision.

For details about the APIs are available in [Registration Processor - Manual Adjudication APIs](Registration-Processor-APIs.md#4-manual-verification-apis).

{% hint style="info" %}
In the current implementation we have the API, assuming that there will be only one Manual Adjudication layer. The APIs for Manual Adjudication can be changed based on the country's need.
